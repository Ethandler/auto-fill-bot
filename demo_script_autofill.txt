ðŸŽ¥ Demo Script: Auto-Fill Bot (Client Work Order Form)

[INTRO]
Hi! This is a quick demo of my Auto-Fill Bot in action, designed to automatically complete client service forms with one click.

[STEP 1 - OPEN FORM]
I have a sample "Client Work Order" form open in the browser. It's used to intake client information like service type, priority, and contact preferences.

[STEP 2 - OPEN SCRIPT]
Next, Iâ€™ll run the Python script. It pulls data from a CSV file and uses PyAutoGUI to simulate human typing and navigation.

[STEP 3 - START SCRIPT]
Once the script starts, I hover my mouse over the first field and let it go. The bot automatically:
- Fills in full name, company, email, and phone number
- Selects the appropriate service and priority from dropdowns
- Checks the correct contact method (email, phone, or text)
- Pastes a project description

[STEP 4 - DONE]
Once all fields are complete, it prints a confirmation in the console. I can now click submit.

[OUTRO]
This tool is perfect for automating repetitive data entry. Use it for lead gen, job boards, or any browser-based form.
